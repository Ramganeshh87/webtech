B.Tech. with Minor Degree

Minor Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML), Cyber Security (CS), Data Science (DS) and Internet of Things (IoT)

CVR College of Engineering offers B.Tech. courses in Civil, CSBS, CSE, CSE (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), CSE (Cyber Security), CSE (Data Science), ECE, EEE, EE (VLSI), EIE, IT and Mechanical Engineering. One of the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 of the Government of India is to offer interdisciplinary courses at all levels of study for comprehensive and far reaching proficiency of students. The AICTE recommends that a student be provided genuine choice in Minor subject.

At CVRCE, all B.Tech. students are provided options to take-up Minor programme in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Cyber Security, Data Science and Internet of Things from third year.

Such flexibility enhances opportunities of graduates in employment in multidisciplinary areas such as Robotics for ME and 3D printing for CE students, to mention a few.

Students with Major CSE (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), CSE (Cyber Security), CSE (Data Science) are eligible to take-up Minor programmes other than their own to gain knowledge in other advanced subjects along with their own, example being Students of B.Tech. Major in CSE (AI&ML) are eligible for Minor in Cyber Security or Data Science or IoT. 

Students need to obtain 160 credits for B.Tech. in Major programme and 18 Credits to qualify for Minor degree. 

Students of current Generation, opportunities are aplenty, it is for you to grab them at the right time and be equipped with skills and competencies to qualify for ever changing needs of the industry across the globe.
